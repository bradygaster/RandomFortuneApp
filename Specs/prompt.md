Generate a detailed implementation plan for the MVP feature in a separate file in specs/mvp_implementation_plan.md. You should have details on database schema, database seed data, and the desired UI components and their layout in the implementation plan. Read through the codebase first to make sure you understand it completely before writing the details of what you need to do to implement it. It is OK to discard any existing schemas (for the fortune telling sample app) as this is a brand new application. In your plan you should make sure to update any names and logging functions that might have referred to this as the fortune app.
